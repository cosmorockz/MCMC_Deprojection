Put all the codes in the same folder of the spectral data. Also put the grid.txt file in the same folder.

Run the main.py file and it will produce data.dat.
data.dat contains the radius, density and temperature.

header.py contains all the parameters for this code. (redshift,metallicity,neutral hydrogen density etc.)
